# T3 Stack Practice

This project uses all the libraries included in create-T3-app, with only react-hook-form and react-icons added. Super simple app, you ask a question and answer a question asked by someone else. There's a profile page that shows all the questions you asked and you can click on a question to see the answers given to a specific question. Google and Discord authentication included with Next-Auth.

I am using a PostgresDB hosted on Railway, so you'll have to copy the .example-env file and change it to fit your own configuration.
